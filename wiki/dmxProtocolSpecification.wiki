#summary DMX protocol specification (Quick)
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

This document includes a view of useful things written a short why.
It isn't the right document to _get started with DMX_ or give a answer
for _what is DMX?_.

= Physical aspects =

== Electrical aspects ==

  * based on RS-485
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-485
    * http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-485
  * refresh rate: 250 kbit/s 
  * asymmetric transition
    * sender and receiver needs the same refresh rate
    * data are enclosed to frames
  * serial transition
  * amplitudes: 0V and 5V


== Connectivity ==

  * cable: 3-Pin XLR plug (not recommended, but diffused)
  * pin setup:
    * 1 = GND
    * 2 = DMX- (invert)
    * 3 = DMX+


== Topologie ==

  * The connectivity between several nodes is based on a physical *bus topologie*.
  * The first node on the bus - called *sender* - supports data are sending thru the bus. The following nodes - called *receiver* - receives the data and make some action.


= Protocol =

== Abstract ==

  * all receiver are updated by some data contained in a *package*
  * a package contains (max.) 512 channels
  * a channel is represented by *one byte* (0x00..0xFF)
  * a channel is enclosed in a *frame* looks like <STARTBIT><8 bit channel data><STOPBIT><STOPBIT>
  * the channel data in a frame starts with *LSB* and ends with *MSB*

== Structure of package ==

The scheme of a DMX package including 512 channels looks like the following picture:
