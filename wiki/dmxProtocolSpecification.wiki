#summary DMX protocol specification (Quick)

= Introduction =

This document includes all the required skills to sending data to DMX bus devices.



= Physical aspects =

== Electrical aspects ==

  * based on RS-485
    * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-485
    * http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIA-485
  * asymmetric and
  * serial transition
  * refresh rate: 250kbit/s 
  * amplitudes: 0V and 5V


== Connectivity ==

  * cable: 3-Pin XLR plug (not recommended, but diffused)
  * pin setup:
    * 1 = GND
    * 2 = DMX- (invert)
    * 3 = DMX+


== Topologie ==

  * The connectivity between several nodes is based on a physical *bus topologie*.
  * The first node on the bus - called *sender* - supports data are sending thru the bus. The following nodes - called *receiver* - receives the data and make some action.
  * max. 32 devices per bus, then it is recommended to refresh singal (e.g. Repeater)


So so...
