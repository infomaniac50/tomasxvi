= Introduction =

Here you can find some (quick) informations about programming the microcontroller ATmega8.
This article based on the (nice and helpful) tutorial at http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR-Tutorial:_IO-Grundlagen (german).

If you search a complete datasheet for the ATmega8, you wont match here.
You can find a offical datasheet/specification at the following location: http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2486.pdf (PDF)

= Before you start reading this article =

All examples described on this quick reference are made with the AVR-Studio in Versio 4.1.3 (http://atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2725) and are coded in assembler.

Every example start with {{{.include "m8def.inc"}}}.
This introduction includes the file {{{<AVRStudio-Install-Dir>\AvrAssembler\Appnotes\m8def.inc}}}. It belongs to the basic scope of the installation. You can view this file in a usual text editor.
It contains some constants for a better understanding the written code.
For example, the expression {{{out DDRB, r16}}} is easier to read than {{{out $17, r16}}}.

{{{DDRB}}} is defined in {{{m8def.inc}}} as {{{.equ DDRB = $17}}}

_Based on [http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2486.pdf ATmega8 datasheet], page 65._

  * the ATmega8 has *three I/O register*
    * register B
    * register C
    * register D
  * each register has a size of *one byte* (eight bits)
  * every bit of these registers are physically *pins* _(0V = 0; 5V = 1)_
  * every pin can use either as *input* or *output* pin
  * the _direction_ (in or out) of each pin can specified via the *DDRx* register (*D*ata *D*irection *R*egister)
  * every I/O register has a data direction register
    * register B => *DDRB*
    * register C => *DDRC*
    * register D => *DDRB*
