#summary Hints on ATmega8 microcontroller

= Introduction =

Here you can find some (quick) informations about programming the microcontroller ATmega8.
This article based on the (nice and helpful) tutorial at http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/AVR-Tutorial:_IO-Grundlagen (german).

If you search a complete datasheet for the ATmega8, you wont match here.
You can find a offical datasheet/specification at the following location: http://www.atmel.com/dyn/resources/prod_documents/doc2486.pdf (PDF)

All examples described on this quick reference are made with the AVR-Studio in Versio 4.1.3 (http://atmel.com/dyn/products/tools_card.asp?tool_id=2725) and are coded in assembler.
