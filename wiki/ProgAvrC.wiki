= Introduction =

This article explains the concepts of programming AVR microprocessors using the C Language. Its intent is not to go in depth regarding the topics covered here; it should moreover be seen as a summarization aided to help the programmer as a quick reference.
Its content is a work in progress.

C tutorials covering the fundamentals needed can be found here, here or here.

== 1. Simple I/O - DDR,PORT,PIN ==

There are 3 types of registers we need to access the 'hardware' pins on the chip: 
===DDR, PORT and PIN===

Data Direction Register :
{{{                                              
DDRA = 0x00;                                   // all Pins as Input
DDRx = 0b01111111;                             // all Pins except the 8.(last) as Output
}}}

PORT Register as *Output*:
{{{
PORTA = 0xff;                                  // all pins = 1
PORTB = 0b01010101;                            // respective pins = 1 or 0
}}}

PORT Register as *Input*:
{{{
PORTA = 0xff;                                  // all pull-up resistors active
}}}

PIN registers are read only:
{{{
uint8_t foo;
foo = PINB;                                    // saves the state of all B pins in foo
}}}
         
===Useful notations===

The following implementations are equal:
{{{
PORTA = 0xC;
PORTA = 0b00001100;
PORTA = (1 << 3) | (1 << 4)
}}}

You could put way more examples here using C bitmanipulations but I'm not fluid in them yet.   (...anyone bored? ;) )

== 2. The UART I/O Interface ==

To communicate with a Computer or any other serial-port equipped device the UART comes into play.
