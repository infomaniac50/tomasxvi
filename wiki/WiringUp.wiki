*AGND* and *AVCC* is the Power Supply of the internal A/D Converter. Gets supplied even if its not being used.

*PB3 - PB5* is used for programming the chip via a SPI cable.

=== Notes about Inputs and Outputs ===

*Input Pins* need either 0V (low) or +5V (high,Vcc). With the pull-up resistor enabled the pin will register as High if it is completely open. This'd make the additional connection to +Vcc expendable in the above example.

*Output Pins* deliver either 0V or 5V.
